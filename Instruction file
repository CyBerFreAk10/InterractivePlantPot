For the AI Agent integration to work, download these dependancies
1. Kivy
2. Homebrew
3. Ollama application with gemma:2b model
4. pyttsx3 library
5. installing ollama in your vs code
6. venv creation (not a dependency to download, it exists)
Use the files advanced_UI_UX.py, ai_agent_trimmed.py first and then with ai_agent_further_trimmed.py and senor_simulator.py
Integrate the above mentioned files by placing all of them within a single folder and use gemini pro to set up the venv environment and execute them 
If possible use static images instead of videos for the plant emotion display
